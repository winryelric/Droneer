Description:
Our project aims to create a programming game which will provide a more fun and engaging
alternative to old ways of learning programming. In this game, players will program a
space drone to engage other drones in combat. They will write the code beforehand in a
separate ide-like part of the game and then complete different combat challenges slowly increasing in difficulty.

It will feature a story mode where the player will slowly learn basic concepts of programming,
an arena mode where they can test their skills against pre-written drones,
and an online mode where they can test their skills against other players.
It will also feature an extensive help page where the user can look up 
basic questions related to the game or programming in general.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Baykam Say : Whole drones package, excluding UpdatableBoard and BoardUpdater.

Alp Üneri : menus package, main class-DroneerMaster and integrating the project

Zübeyir Bodur : ide package-adding user friendly features to IDE, simplifying the Editor class; and a little part of menus package
where user choose which drone to play in Quick Battle

Uður Erdem Seyfi Küçük : ide package- core of the ide package(compiler, saving & opening files); UpdatableBoard,
BoardUpdater from drones package and a method in Board class,
which required not so simple mathemathics.

Ege Kaan Gürkan : menus package and help screen-UI designer of the project.

Agil Aliyev : settings screen, help screen.
